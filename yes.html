                    Hi Thirak. I just wanna tell you how much you mean to me <3. You are literally my 
                    favourite boy in the entire world and i cannot express how much fun i have when i'm 
                    with you. Whenever i see your big doe eyes and that cute smirk, my heart skips a beat :) Thank you
                    so much for being there in my life <333 It's crazy to think how one stupid DM can 
                    change my life. You motivate me to be better and make me feel like i'm worth it.
                </p>
